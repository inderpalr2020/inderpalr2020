## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Site Reliability & DevOps Engineering leader with deep experience designing,
operating, and scaling **mission-critical platforms** across global enterprises.

Currently, I lead SRE initiatives at **adidas**, driving reliability, operational
maturity, and platform scalability for large-scale digital retail systems spanning
cloud and on-prem environments.

My work focuses on:
- Translating business goals into **reliable, observable, and efficient systems**
- Reducing operational toil through **automation and engineering leverage**
- Designing **production systems that scale gracefully under failure**
- Evolving observability for **AI-driven and agentic architectures**

I’m known for a calm, execution-focused leadership style, strong cross-functional
collaboration, and operating effectively in high-impact, ambiguous environments.
